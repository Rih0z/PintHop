# PintHop üçª

## Find your next pint. Whether alone or with friends.

**PintHop** is an open-source app with two core functions to enhance your craft beer experience:

1. **Discover your next pint**: Easily find beers that match your preferences or are highly rated, enhancing the quality of your beer experiences
2. **Connect with the community**: Enable natural meet-ups with friends and share knowledge of the beer community

Whether you're enjoying beer alone or drinking with friends, PintHop enriches your beer experience. You can know where your friends are and what beers they're enjoying without prior planning or explicit invitations, allowing for natural meet-ups, or you can explore new beers on your own.

## üåü Concept

PintHop is an app that fuses two core experiences:

- **Discover your next pint**:
  - Support encounters with quality beers
  - Visualization of breweries' specialty styles and award history
  - Centralized display of review site ratings
  - Community sharing of tap list information

- **Create natural connections**:
  - **Zero psychological barriers**: No social pressure of "inviting/being invited"
  - **Real-time presence**: Instantly know where your friends are
  - **Natural meet-ups**: Creating encounters that appear coincidental without planning
  - **Privacy-focused**: Complete control over how much of your information is shared

A design that enhances both the joy of exploring new beers alone and the fun of accidentally meeting friends and drinking together.

## üí´ Main Features

- **One-tap check-in**: Just tap when you arrive at a brewery. No detailed input required
- **Ambient presence display**: Subtly notify where your friends are
- **Stay time sharing**: Simple information display like "I'll be here for about another hour"
- **Plan visualization**: See today's/this week's brewery visit plans (optional sharing)
- **Group dynamics**: Natural visibility of friend group formation and movement
- **Real-time map**: See currently active spots and which friends are there
- **Tap list sharing**: Users upload the latest tap list photos
- **Brewery detailed information**: Display specialty styles, award history, and ratings from each review site
- **Beer recording**: Easily record beers consumed and review chronologically
- **Beer style search**: Search for beers by BJCP-compliant style classification

## üöÄ Differences from Conventional Apps

### 1. Integration of Beer Discovery and Community
- **Conventional Beer Apps**: Focus on recording and collection, social elements are secondary
- **PintHop**: Natural fusion of beer discovery experience and real-time connections
- **Integrated Value**: Creating synergy between "which beer to drink" and "who to drink with"

### 2. "Presence" Rather Than "Posting"
- **Conventional SNS**: Post and share places visited and things consumed afterward
- **PintHop**: Simple sharing of where you are now is the beginning of everything
- **Experience over Recording**: Photos and reviews are secondary, first improving the quality of the experience

### 3. Elimination of Psychological Hurdles
- **Conventional Apps**: Explicit flow of "invite ‚Üí approve/decline"
- **PintHop**: Only information presentation of "I am here now," no obligation to respond
- **Natural Participation**: Possibility of ambiguous expressions of intent like "might go" or "interested"

### 4. Real-time Experience
- **Conventional SNS**: Recording of past activities and coordination of future plans
- **PintHop**: Presence focused on "this moment now"
- **Immediacy**: Know which places and friends are active the moment you open the app

### 5. Integration of Beer Information
- **Conventional Beer Apps**: Individual reviews and check-ins are dispersed
- **PintHop**: Centralized display of ratings from multiple review sites, specialty styles, and tap lists
- **Fulfilling Even Alone**: Enhancing the quality of solo drinking with unique beer recommendations and information aggregation
